# Tea & Suppliments for Cardiovascular Benefits

To maximize your results, it is important to use the correct **botanical parts** of the plant. Studies are very specific about this because the active compounds (like anthocyanins or oleuropein) are concentrated in particular areas.

### Preparation Protocols

#### 1. The Hot Brew Group (Olive Leaf & Hawthorn)

##### Olive Leaf

* **Why:** These are leathery leaves, cold water simply isn't "aggressive" enough to pull out the **Oleuropein** or **Crataegus flavonoids**.
* **Method:** For 8 oz, steep 2.5g to 3.0g, steep in **185F** water for **20 minutes**.
* **To Drink Cold:** Once the 20-minute steep is done, pour the "concentrate" over a large glass of ice.
* **To Store**: Let cool to room temp, add stablizing citrus, seal in dark jar for up to 5 days

##### Hawthorne Leaf and Flower (does not apply to berries)

* **Why:** These are leathery leaves, cold water simply isn't "aggressive" enough to pull out the **Oleuropein** or **Crataegus flavonoids**.
* **Method:** For 8 oz, steep 2.5g to 3.0g, steep in **176F** water for **30 minutes**, covered (This may need to have an external heater to keep temp)
* **To Drink Cold:** Once the 30-minute steep is done, pour the "concentrate" over a large glass of ice.
* **To Store**: Let cool to room temp, add stablizing citrus, seal in dark jar for up to 5 days
* **The Bitterness Factor:** Because 30 minutes is an incredibly long steep, the tea will be very astringent. If it's too bitter to drink, you can dilute the resulting concentrate with a bit of room-temperature water.
* **Thermal Insulation:** To keep the water at that specific for the full 30 minutes such as a heating plate.
* **Vessel Material:** Use **glass or ceramic**. Avoid steeping for 30 minutes in plastic or low-grade stainless steel to ensure no metallic off-flavors migrate into your heart-healthy brew.

##### Heart Trio Blend
* **What** When you blend these three, you are engaging three distinct biological mechanisms:
  * Hibiscus: Acts as a natural ACE inhibitor, helping to relax the blood vessels and manage fluid balance (blood pressure).
  * Olive Leaf: Provides Oleuropein, which prevents the oxidation of LDL cholesterol—a key step in maintaining clean, slick arterial walls.
  * Hawthorn: Rich in Vitexin, it improves the contractility of the heart muscle and enhances blood flow through the coronary arteries.
* **Why:** To get these three very different plant materials to release their nutrients at the same time, follow this specific ratio and temperature. 
* **Method:** 
  * For 10-12 oz, steep 1 g of each Olive Leaf, Hawthorn Leaf and Hibiscus, steep in **185F** water for **20 minutes**.
  * Covered use an external hotplate to keep temp
  * Addition of stablizing citrus is required after cooling to room temperature
* **To Drink Cold:** Once the 20-minute steep is done, pour the "concentrate" over a large glass of ice.
* **To Store**: Let cool to room temp, add stablizing citrus, seal in dark jar for up to 48 hours.

#### 2. The Cold Brew Group (Matcha & Hibiscus)

When cold brewing, you generally want to increase the tea-to-water ratio slightly compared to hot brewing. Because cold water is less "aggressive" at extracting flavor, a higher concentration of tea ensures a rich, umami-forward cup without the bitterness.  Cold brewing green tea extracts significantly less caffeine while still pulling out high levels of EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate). If you are sensitive to the "jitters" but want the cardiovascular benefits, this is actually the superior method.

* **Why:** Cold brewing Green Tea preserves the **EGCG** and lowers caffeine (better for BP). Hibiscus cold brews well if given enough time. 
* **Method:**
  * **Hibiscus:** 
    * Steep in the fridge for **12 hours** (overnight). 
    * **Ratio:** Use **1.25g to 1.5g** of dried hibiscus per 8 oz (3 tea bags per 16 oz). Use 1.5x the amount of dried flowers you would use for hot tea to ensure the same potency. 
    * Add acidic stablizer after removing tea leaves keep beneficial for up to 48 hours in a dark/covered jar
      * Fill entire jar to reduce oxidation
      * Remove tea bags/leaves after steeping time to avoid bitterness and spoilage
  * **Soy-Matcha Green Tea:** Steep in the fridge for **6–8 hours** 
    * Use a jar that has a good sealing lid matcha can be shaken (vs cold whisked). Alternatively use frother to mix (makes mess)
    * Standard Strength: 1 teaspoon (approx. 2g), Strong/Ceremonial: 1.5 to 2 teaspoons (3–4g) per 8 oz
    * Use Soy Milk, without additives, for best outcome. Cow milk can also be used. Avoid Almond milk.
    * Using milk removes the need for acid stabilizer, removes the risk of oxalates build up in kidneys

#### 3. The Morning Hybrid (Hibiscus Hot)

* **Why:** Your morning dose should be the most potent to combat morning hypertension.
* **Method:** I recommend brewing your first cup of the day **Hot** (steep 10 mins) to ensure maximum anthocyanin extraction. If you hate hot tea in the morning, use the flash-chill method mentioned above.
* Water temperature to **194F**. Hibiscus is hardy and requires higher heat to extract the anthocyanins responsible for blood pressure benefits.

#### Stablization

For all the teas above, remember to add a **squeeze of lemon**. Whether the tea is hot or cold, the Vitamin C stabilizes the antioxidants, preventing them from being destroyed by your stomach acid before they can reach your arteries. Citrus also allows extending the storage time for cold brew or flash-chilled methods.

##### Citrus Additions

Since different fruits have different concentrations of citric acid and Vitamin C, the amount you need varies to reach that stabilization zone without making the tea unpalatably sour.

For an **8 oz cup**, here are the recommended amounts:

| Fruit | Amount per 8 oz | Why this amount? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lemon** | **1 teaspoon** (approx. 1/6th of a lemon) | Highest citric acid content; very efficient at stabilizing EGCG. |
| **Lime** | **1 teaspoon** | Similar to lemon, though slightly more "zesty" flavor. |
| **Orange** | **1-2 tablespoons** (approx. 1/4th of an orange) | Lower acidity; you need more volume to achieve the same pH drop. |
| **Grapefruit** | **1 tablespoon** | Moderately acidic, but the bitterness can mask the tea's profile. |

#### **Perfect Stabilization Strategy**

##### Citrus also allows batch prep the **7-Day Heart-Healthy Rotation**, the best approach is a combination:

* **For the Batch Prep (Stability):** Use **Lemon or Lime** because the high citric acid content keeps the brew stable in the fridge for 2–3 days.
* **Just Before Drinking (Absorption):** If you used a low-acid fruit like orange for flavor, adding a tiny pinch of pure **ascorbic acid powder** (or a fresh squeeze of orange) right before you drink will give you that final boost in absorption.

##### **The Temperature Red Zones**

| Temperature | Impact on Vitamin C | Strategy for Your Rotation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Below 158F** | **Minimal Loss** | Safe zone. Perfect for adding citrus to your cold brews or slightly cooled green tea. |
| **159F to 185F** | **Moderate Loss** | Significant degradation begins after 5–10 minutes. This is why we wait for "Hot Prep" to cool slightly. |
| **186F to 212F** | **Rapid Loss** | Boiling water can destroy up to **25-50%** of the Vitamin C in citrus juice almost 

### Weekly Batch Schedule

To keep your **7-Day Heart-Healthy Rotation** efficient and ensure you’re getting the maximum antioxidant potency, a weekly prep cycle is the sweet spot to get you through the rest of the week and into a sustainable rhythm.

#### **Session 1: Sunday Morning**

* Prep for Sun Heart Trio Blend
* Brew 30 to 36 oz for the day
* Store in thermos or chill
* Use acid stabilizer

#### **Session 2: Sunday Evening (The Weekday Foundation)**

* **Prep for Mon/Wed:**
* **Hibiscus:** Cold brew 2 x 16 oz (4 servings). Hibiscus stays potent longer, so a Sunday batch easily lasts through Monday/Tuesday. Make sure to add citrus after removing teabags brewing.
* **Olive Leaf:** Hot prep 16 oz using the **Clinical Protocol**. Store in an airtight glass jar with acidic stablizer once cooled.

#### **Session 3: Tuesday Morning**

* **Matcha Green Tea:** Cold brew 8 oz (1 serving) for 6 - 8 hours, using same day.

#### **Session 4: Wednesday Evening (The Weekend Refresh)**

* **Prep for Thu/Fri/Sat:**
* **Hibiscus Refresh:** Cold brew 24 oz Thu/Fri/Sat.
* **Hawthorn:** Hot prep 16 oz using the **Clinical Protocol**. Store in an airtight glass jar with acidic stablizer once cooled.

#### **Session 5: Friday Morning**
* **Matcha Green Tea:** Cold brew 8 oz (1 serving) for 6 - 8 hours, using same day. 

## **Golden Rules for Your Batch Prep**

1. **Fill to the Brim Rule:** When storing your cold brew in the fridge, use jars that match your batch size. Minimal air at the top of the jar means minimal oxidation.
2. **Use to Smallest Jar Rule:** When taking a serving from a large jar, place the remaining for storage in a smallest container it will fit into reduce trapped air and reduce oxidation.
3. **The Glass-Only Rule:** Since we are using a **Clinical Protocol**, avoid plastic containers. Plastic can leach chemicals over a 3-day storage period, especially if you pour the tea in while it's still warm.
4. **Label Your Lids:** Use a dry-erase marker on your jar lids to write the **date of prep**. 

### Checklist for Buying

#### The Botanical specifics

* **Hibiscus:** You must use the **calyces** (the fleshy red part that holds the flower) of the **Hibiscus sabdariffa** species. Most Hibiscus tea sold in stores uses this, but avoid ornamental hibiscus from your garden.
* **Green Tea:** Most research uses **Sencha** (leaf) or **Matcha** (powdered leaf). Matcha is significantly more potent as you consume the entire leaf.
* **Olive Leaf:** Look for **dried, whole, or crushed leaves** (Olea europaea). The oleuropein content is what matters; avoid olive fruit teas which lack this compound.
* **Hawthorn:** Studies suggest a **combination of leaf and flower** (Crataegi folium cum flore) is often more effective than just the berries, as the leaves/flowers contain higher concentrations of flavonoids.

In clinical research, scientists often use specific standardized extracts or reputable commercial brands to ensure that the levels of active compounds are consistent. The following brands and specific standardized extracts have been directly used or identified in major clinical trials for blood pressure:

#### 1. Hibiscus (*Hibiscus sabdariffa*)

* **Celestial Seasonings:** This is perhaps the most famous commercial connection. The landmark **Tufts University study** (McKay et al., 2010) collaborated with Celestial Seasonings. While the study used a standardized blend, their Re Zinger line is primarily hibiscus-based and mirrors the profile used in the trial.
* **Badia:** Used in a 2019 randomized clinical trial (published in *Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology & Research*) where 2 cups daily showed significant reduction in Stage 1 hypertension.
* **Traditional Medicinals:** Often cited by herbalists as a pharmacopoeial grade alternative, as they test for specific active constituent levels, which mimics the standardized tea protocols used in hospital-based trials.

#### 2. Green Tea (*Camellia sinensis*)

* **Ito En (Oi Ocha):** Frequently used in Japanese clinical studies. It is known for its high catechin content and consistency.
* **Taiyo Kagaku (Sunphenon):** Many trials don't use a bagged tea but rather a standardized extract called **Sunphenon**. If you are looking for tea that matches this, look for brands that specify high-catechin or standardized EGCG on the label.

#### 3. Olive Leaf (*Olea europaea*)

* **Benolea (EFLA 943):** This is the gold standard in olive leaf research. It is a patented extract used in the most famous Olive Leaf vs. Captopril study. It is standardized to **16–24% Oleuropein**.
* **Where to find it:** While Benolea is an ingredient, brands like **Life Extension** or **Frutarom** use this specific clinical extract in their formulations.
* **Maiservas (+ervas):** A Portuguese biological products company whose dried olive leaves were used in 2022/2023 cross-over trials for metabolic and vascular health.

#### 4. Hawthorn (*Crataegus*)

* **Dr. Willmar Schwabe (Crataegus Extract WS 1442):** This specific standardized extract from leaves and flowers is the most extensively researched Hawthorn product in the world.
* **Note:** It is typically sold as a supplement, brand name **Special Extract WS 1442**, rather than a loose tea, because the specific flavonoid concentration is difficult to maintain in home-brewed tea.

#### Purchase Summary
If you can't find the exact clinical brand, look for these Clinical Grade markers on the packaging to ensure you are getting the dosage used in the studies:

| Tea Type | What to Look for on the Label |
| --- | --- |
| **Hibiscus** | Must be Hibiscus sabdariffa; look for deep red color indicates high anthocyanins. |
| **Green Tea** | Standardized to 45% EGCG or Japanese Sencha. |
| **Olive Leaf** | Standardized to 18% Oleuropein or EFLA 943 extract. |
| **Hawthorn** | Leaf and Flower blend, avoid Berry-only for BP. |

### Timeline to Effectiveness

Research indicates that these teas are not instant like a pill; they work by gradually improving the health of your blood vessel linings.

* **7 to 14 Days:** Initial soft drop. You might see a **2–4 point** reduction in systolic pressure as the diuretic effects of Hibiscus kick in.
* **4 to 6 Weeks:** This is the Clinical Sweet Spot. This is when most studies, particularly on **Hibiscus Sabdariffa**. show a significant **7–13 point** drop in systolic pressure.
* **8 to 12 Weeks:** Maximum benefit for **Green Tea** and **Olive Leaf**. By this point, your blood vessels have typically become more flexible improved flow-mediated dilation.

## Structural Reversal Power Stack

To target structural plaque reversal—specifically the hardening and narrowing of arteries—clinical research looks for substances that go beyond simple relaxation and actively address **calcification** and **plaque volume**.

When paired with your tea rotation, the following foods and supplements create a powerful synergy by addressing the three main components of plaque: calcium buildup, oxidized cholesterol, and inflammation.

| Supplement/Food | Role in Plaque Reversal | Pair With |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Vitamin K2 (MK-7)** | Clears calcium from artery walls. | **Hibiscus Tea** both lower BP. |
| **Pomegranate Juice** | Reduces physical wall thickness. | **Green Tea** synergistic antioxidants. |
| **Aged Garlic Extract** | Stops plaque from hardening. | **Morning Tea dose**. |
| **Lemon/Vitamin C** | Increases tea absorption by 500%. | **Every cup of tea**. |

### Synergy Protocol

To maximize these supplements alongside your tea:

1. **Morning:** With your hot Hibiscus Tea, take **D3/K2** and **Aged Garlic** with a meal containing healthy fats (avocado or eggs) to ensure the vitamins are absorbed. 
2. **Mid-Day:** Drink your **Tea** with **Citrus Juice** to boost catechin absorption. Drink Pomegranate Juice.
3. **Evening:** Drink your **Hibiscus Tea**. 
4. Swish with plain water immediately after drinking Hibiscus tea to prevent damage to tooth Enamel.
5. Eat **150 mg to 250 mg** of calcium with non-milk-matcha teas to bind to oxalates, to reduce the risk of developing kidney stones. This calcium is sacraficial and should not be counted towards daily nutritional counts. (calories and other nutriants do) The matcha cold-brewed with milk do not require this addition.
  * 1 oz Aged Gouda is ~225 mg per serving
  * 6 oz Greek Yogurt has ~195 mg per serving
  * 1/2 oz Parmesan has ~200 mg per serving
  * 6 oz Feta has ~ 210 mg per serving
  * 3 oz Ricotta has ~ 250 mg per serving
5. Calcium and iron Levels, drink tea 90 mins away from meals. Tea will prevent absorbsion of minerals, does not apply the the sacraficial calcium above.
6. Don't drink Matcha or Olive Leaf on a 100% empty stomach.
7. Drink 8 oz of plain water for every 2 cups of tea to flush oxalates.

### Shopping List

In clinical research, Clinical Grade refers to supplements that have been independently verified for purity, such as USP or NSF certification or are the exact patented versions used in successful human trials. Below are the specific brands and formulations most frequently cited in studies for arterial health and plaque management.

#### 1. Aged Garlic Extract (AGE)

**Clinical Standard:** **Kyolic by Wakunaga of America**
This is the single most researched garlic brand in the world. It was used in the famous UCLA heart studies (Dr. Matthew Budoff) and the GarGIC trials.

* **The Formulation:** **Kyolic Formula 100 Cardiovascular** or **Kyolic Reserve**.
* **Clinical Dose:** Trials for plaque reversal typically use **1,200 mg to 2,400 mg** per day.
* **Key Marker:** Standardized to **S-allyl cysteine SAC**. Studies show that 2.4 mg of SAC daily is the threshold for slowing coronary calcification.

#### 2. Vitamin K2 (MK-7)

**Clinical Standard: MenaQ7®, a Patented Ingredient**
Researchers rarely use generic K2. Most successful trials on arterial stiffness use **MenaQ7®**, a patented form of MK-7 derived from fermented chickpeas.

* **Where to find it:** Because MenaQ7 is an ingredient, you will find it inside high-end brands.
* **SwissRX:** Specifically uses the MenaQ7 PRO version used in cardiovascular research.
* **Thorne Vitamin D/K2 Liquid:** Highly regarded for its purity and used by professional athletic organizations.
* **Clinical Dose:** 180 mcg per day. (Note: New 2026 guidelines suggest up to 360 mcg/day is safe and effective for arterial health).

#### 3. Vitamin D3

**Clinical Standard:** **Nature Made (USP Verified)** or **Pure Encapsulations**
For D3, the gold standard is **USP Verification** (U.S. Pharmacopeia), which ensures the bottle actually contains the IU amount listed.

* **Nature Made:** Holds the most USP-verified products in the US.
* **Pure Encapsulations:** Frequently used in clinical settings because they are "hypoallergenic" and free from fillers that might interfere with absorption.
* **Clinical Dose:**  (to be adjusted based on your blood serum levels).

#### 4. Pomegranate Extract

**Clinical Standard:** **P40p™** or **POM Wonderful**
Research into carotid artery thickening specifically used **POM Wonderful** juice or the standardized extract **P40p**.

* **The Formulation:** Look for extracts standardized to **30% Punicalagins**.
* **Standardized Brand:** **Life Extension (Pomegranate Fruit Extract)** uses a standardized blend that mirrors the polyphenol profile used in clinical trials.
* **Clinical Dose:** Equivalent to **8oz of juice** or **400mg–1,000mg** of standardized extract.

#### Summary Table for "Clinical Grade" Shopping

| Nutrient | Specific Clinical Brand/Ingredient | Key Certification to Look For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Aged Garlic** | **Kyolic (Formula 100)** | "Aged 20 Months" |
| **Vitamin K2** | **MenaQ7®** (found in SwissRX or Jarrow) | "Patented MK-7" |
| **Vitamin D3** | **Nature Made** or **Thorne** | **USP Verified** or **NSF** |
| **Pomegranate** | **Life Extension** or **POM Wonderful** | "Standardized Punicalagins" |

### Suppliments Effects in Structural Reversal Power Stack 

#### 1. Calcium Scavengers (Vitamin K2 + D3)

This is arguably the most important pairing for structural hardening.

* **The Synergy:** While **Vitamin D3** helps you absorb calcium, **Vitamin K2 (specifically the MK-7 form)** acts as a traffic cop. It activates a protein called *Matrix Gla Protein (MGP)*, which physically pulls calcium out of your arterial walls and shuttles it into your bones.
* **The Evidence:** A 2025 review indicates that combined deficiency in these vitamins is linked to significantly higher arterial stiffness. Long-term K2 intake is associated with a **50% reduction in arterial calcification**.
* **Clinical Dose:** Typically  of K2 (MK-7) alongside  of D3.

#### 2. The "Plaque Shrinker" (Pomegranate Juice)

Pomegranate is one of the few natural substances with clinical evidence for actually **reducing** the thickness of the carotid artery.

* **The Synergy:** Pomegranate polyphenols (punicalagins) protect the **Nitric Oxide** produced by your tea from being destroyed by oxidative stress.
* **The Evidence:** In a famous 3rd-party trial, patients with carotid artery stenosis who drank pomegranate juice daily for one year saw a **30% reduction in carotid intima-media thickness** (the physical thickness of the artery wall).
* **Dosage:** 8 oz (240ml) of 100% pure, unsweetened pomegranate juice daily.

#### 3. Bioavailability Booster (Vitamin C + Citrus)

Green tea and Hibiscus catechins are notoriously difficult for the body to absorb (often less than 20% reaches the bloodstream).

* **The Synergy:** Adding **Vitamin C** or citrus juice (lemon/lime) to your tea changes the pH level in your gut, preventing the tea's antioxidants from breaking down before they can be absorbed.
* **The Evidence:** Laboratory models show that adding citrus to green tea increases catechin recovery by **over 5 times**.
* **Practice:** Squeeze **half a lemon** into every cup of Green or Hibiscus tea.

#### 4. Inflammation Shield (Aged Garlic Extract)

While raw garlic is great, **Aged Garlic Extract (AGE)** is what researchers use for structural plaque.

* **The Synergy:** It helps prevent "soft" plaque from turning into "hard" calcified plaque.
* **The Evidence:** Multiple studies using the brand **Kyolic** have shown a significantly slower progression of total plaque volume and a reduction in "low-attenuation" (vulnerable) plaque over a 12-month period.
* **Dosage:** 1,200mg to 2,400mg of Aged Garlic Extract daily.

#### A Note on Timeframes

Structural reversal is much slower than functional blood pressure drops. While your blood pressure may stabilize in **4–6 weeks**, structural changes to the artery walls (like those seen in the pomegranate and K2 studies) generally require **12 to 36 months** of consistent adherence.
