**Preston Lifestyle - based off of Mediterranean Lifestyle**  
  
Get started with these tips:  
* Build meals around vegetables, beans and whole grains.  
* Eat fish at least twice a week.  
* Use olive oil instead of butter in preparing food.  
* Serve fresh fruit for dessert & snacks  
* Make one meal per day vegetarian    
* By the plate visual: 50% veggies / fruits, 23% grains, 25% protein & legumes, 2% fat  
    * The ‘fat’ should not be really visible; most comes in the form of EVOO  
        * 2% visible fat may come from fatty foods - avocado, goat cheese, seeds  
    * Note this is *not* the macros but how a meal plate should look  
    * Modified above for dinners - remove carbs and starchy veggies  
  
1. Exercise  
    * Whole body & core strength training workouts

    * Balance Exercises  
        * Step-up exercises

Below serving size appears to be good guidelines, the ‘Tips’ range from ok to contrary.   
  
Nothing in the med diet says you need to eat ‘low fat’ cheese and milk. Also ‘eggs’ but avoid the yokes, did they do that back when this diet was studied? (No!!)  
  
This is a hold-over from the previous low-fat craze that lead us to our current empty carb-tastrophie.
