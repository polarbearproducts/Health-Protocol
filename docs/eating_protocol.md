# Eating Protocol - based off of Mediterranean Lifestyle (Diet)  
  
## General Tips

* Start small and build into this protocol
* Forgive yourself for the rare, odd missed day, do better the next day
* Cook at home, build meals around vegetables, beans and whole grains 
* Eat fish at least twice a week
* Use olive oil instead of butter in preparing food  
* Serve fresh fruit for dessert & snacks  
* Make one meal per day vegetarian
* By the plate visual: 50% veggies / fruits, 23% grains, 25% protein & legumes, 2% fat
    * The ‘fat’ should not be really visible; most comes in the form of EVOO  
    * 2% visible fat may come from fatty foods - avocado, goat cheese, seeds
* Note this is *not* the macros but how a meal plate should look  
* Revisit this site for updates and reminders or to suggest improvements

1.  Drink liquids at least 15.5 cups of fluids

   * Coffee  
   * Teas (see Tea Protocol)  
   * Water

2.  Limit salt intake / avoid excess salt

   * Swap salted nuts with unsalted  
   * Buy canned veggies, beans and sauces with no salt added
   * It is typical to add salt while cooking with these products but this allow *you* to control the salt amount

3.  Each 30 different plants, seeds and nuts a week / Eat the color spectrum of veggies

   * Not just fruits and veggies that count, you can include grains, nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices, too  

4.  Eat Clean - whole foods. Avoid ultra-processed foods, including any food that has more than 5 ingredients

5.  Eat light dinners (salad), eliminate starchy carbs at night (rice, pasta, potatoes, breads)  

   * Eat low-glycemic index foods  

6.  Increase fiber intake, generally wholegrains, whole fruits, pulses/beans, nuts and seeds  

   * I swap to Barley for Oatmeal for breakfast in order to reduce Glucose impacts  

### 7. Time of Day Eating

    * Limit eating hours to 10 hours per day
    * Don't eat after 9 pm (water, coffee, tea is ok)
    * Don't eat starchy/high-sugar snacks/drinks after 3 pm (Have that piece of See's Candy before)

### 8. Do not eat  

    * fried foods  
    * processed meats, spam, ham, bacon, jerky, hot dogs, sausage  
    * processed shrimp (lots of salt in processing)  
    * canned soup
    * pizza  
    * flour tortillas and fried tortillas (corn or flour, either one of these is tough for me to avoid)  
    * refried beans  
    * fruit juices  
    * Ingredients that indicate ultra-processed foods & additives:  
    * ++High-fructose corn syrup++  
    * Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)  
    * Carrageenan  
    * ++Food dyes++  
    * ++Hydrogenated oils++  
    * ++Monosodium glutamate (MSG)++  
    * Potassium bromate  
    * **Sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite.**  
    * Sulfites (like sulfur dioxide, potassium bisulfite, sodium bisulfite and sodium sulfite).  
    * potassium nitrate  
    * **potassium sorbates**  
    * potassium metabisulfite  
    * acetates  
    * tocopherols & alpha-tocopherol  
    * **sodium ascorbate**  
    * **erythorbates**  
    * citric acid  
    * **phosphoric acid**  
    * extracts of rosemary  
    * calcium propionate  

### 9. Limit

    * Sweets
      * one exception is high content coco powder 80% or more chocolate, but limit to 1 oz
    * Dairy
      * Dairy fits in the limit category, limit overall to 2 servings per day
      * Servings: 1 cup Greek yogurt, 1.5 oz cheese
      * The majority of this amount is taken up by the sacrificial cheese (1 oz) in the tea protocol
      * Most websites promote 'non-fat' dairy versions, I believe this is an error as it is a throwback to 'all fat is bad' which got us into the over-carb diets we have today. Back when the MD study was being performed 'fat-free' dairy didn't exist.
    * Crackers  
    * Condiments / sauces  
    * Salad dressings (Make your own EVOO, Vinegar, Mustard)  
    * Canned veggies (or change to no-salt)
    * Canned beans (or use dried if no-salt canned are not available)
    * Canned sauces (tomato, pasta, etc) (or get no-salt added)  
    * Pickles  
    * Breads
