# Eating Protocol

The following is based off of the Mediterranean 'diet', unlike other modern diets, the Mediterranean diet does not eliminate any whole food. The studies conducted on the Mediterranean region were made during the 1960s prior to our modern food ultra processed food craze.

 The key tenets of the Mediterranean diet include a high intake of plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes, with olive oil as the primary source of fat. It also emphasizes moderate consumption of fish, poultry, dairy, and limited red meat, along with enjoying meals with family and friends.

## General Tips

* Start small and build into this protocol
* Forgive yourself for the rare, odd missed day, do better the next day
* Cook at home, build meals around vegetables, beans and whole grains
* Eat fish at least twice a week
* Use olive oil instead of butter in preparing food
* Serve fresh fruit for dessert & snacks
* Make one meal per day vegetarian
* By the plate visual: 50% veggies / fruits, 23% grains, 25% protein & legumes, 2% fat
    * The fat should not be really visible; most comes in the form of EVOO, 2% visible fat may come from fatty foods - avocado, goat cheese, seeds
* Note this is not the macros but how a meal plate should look
* Revisit this site for updates and reminders or to suggest improvements

## Drink Liquids

At least 15.5 cups of fluids per day

* Coffee
* Teas (see Tea Protocol)
* Water

## Limit salt intake

* Swap salted nuts with unsalted
* Buy canned veggies, beans and sauces with no salt added
* It is typical to add salt while cooking with these products but this allow *you* to control the salt amount

## Spectrum

* Eat seasonal fruits and vegetables
* Each 30 different plants, seeds and nuts a week
    * Not just fruits and veggies that count, you can include grains, nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices, too

## Eat light dinners

* Eat light dinners, shift major meal to lunch
* Avoid starchy carbs at night (rices, pasta, potatoes, breads)
* Eat low-glycemic index foods at night

## Increase fiber intake

* Increase wholegrains, whole fruits, pulses/beans, nuts and seeds
* Swap to Barley for Oatmeal for breakfast in order to reduce Glucose impacts

## Time of Day Eating

* Limit eating hours to 10 hours per day
* Don't eat after 9 pm (water, coffee, tea is ok)
* Don't eat starchy/high-sugar snacks/drinks after 3 pm (Have that piece of See's Candy before)

## Do not eat

Don't go here

* Fried foods
* Processed meats, spam, ham, bacon, jerky, hot dogs, sausage
* Processed shrimp (lots of salt in processing) [Eat Fresh Shrimp!!]
* Canned soup
* Pizza
* Flour tortillas and fried tortillas (corn or flour, either one of these is tough for me to avoid)
* Refried beans
* Indication of being an ultra-processed food:
    * Contains more than 5 ingredients
    * High-fructose corn syrup
    * Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)
    * Carrageenan
    * Artificial Food dyes (even question natural dyes)
    * Hydrogenated oils
    * Monosodium glutamate (MSG)
    * Potassium bromate
    * Sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite
    * Sulfites (like sulfur dioxide, potassium bisulfite, sodium bisulfite and sodium sulfite)  
    * Potassium nitrate
    * Potassium sorbates
    * Potassium metabisulfite
    * Acetates
    * Tocopherols & alpha-tocopherol
    * Sodium ascorbate
    * Phosphoric acid
    * Extracts of rosemary
    * Calcium propionate

## Limit

* Sweets
    * One exception is high content coco powder 80% or more chocolate, but limit to 1 oz every few days
* Dairy
    * Dairy fits in the limit category, limit overall to 2 servings per day
    * Servings: 1 cup Greek yogurt, 1.5 oz cheese
    * The majority of this amount is taken up by the sacrificial cheese (1 oz) in the tea protocol
    * Most websites promote 'non-fat' dairy versions, I believe this is an error as it is a throwback to 'all fat is bad' which got us into the over-carb diets we have today. Back when the MD study was being performed 'fat-free' dairy didn't exist
* Crackers
* Condiments / sauces
* Salad dressings (Make your own EVOO, Vinegar, Mustard)
* Canned veggies (or change to no-salt)
* Canned beans (or use dried if no-salt canned are not available)
* Canned sauces (tomato, pasta, etc) (or get no-salt added)
* Pickles

* Fruit juices
* Red meat/beef - typically only eaten during major celebrations
* Pork - typically only eaten during major celebrations
