# Eating Protocol - based off of Mediterranean Lifestyle (Diet)  
  
Get started with these tips:

* Start small and build into this protocol
* Forgive yourself for the rare, odd missed day, do better the next day
* Cook at home, build meals around vegetables, beans and whole grains 
* Eat fish at least twice a week
* Use olive oil instead of butter in preparing food  
* Serve fresh fruit for dessert & snacks  
* Make one meal per day vegetarian
* By the plate visual: 50% veggies / fruits, 23% grains, 25% protein & legumes, 2% fat
  * The ‘fat’ should not be really visible; most comes in the form of EVOO  
    * 2% visible fat may come from fatty foods - avocado, goat cheese, seeds
    * Note this is *not* the macros but how a meal plate should look  
    * For dinners - remove carbs, breads and starchy veggies  
* Revisit this site for updates and reminders or to suggest improvements

    * Water
1. Limit salt intake / avoid excess salt  
    * Swap salted nuts with unsalted  
    * Buy canned veggies, beans and sauces with no salt added
        * It is typical to add salt while cooking with these products but this allow *you* to control the salt amount
