# Creatine Protocol

To resolve texture issues ("grittiness") and optimize absorption without interfering with the savory flavor of meals use one of the options in the delivery hierarchy.

## Creatine Delivery Hierarchy

To optimize the transport of 5g of Creatine Monohydrate into the muscle and brain cells, use the following ranked strategies based on insulin response and solubility.

### 1. Best: With Functional Breakfasts

* **Mechanism:** The combination of high-quality protein and slow-burn carbohydrates triggers a steady insulin curve, which is the most effective driver for creatine transport.
* **Note:** To avoid the "gritty" texture, stir the creatine into the yogurt or the liquid of the beans.

### 2. Great: With Pomegranate Juice

* **Mechanism:** 4-6 oz of pomegranate juice provides a moderate glycemic response to trigger insulin while contributing punicalagins for nitric oxide support.
* **Note:** This is an ideal "bridge" if you miss your breakfast dose. Avoid doing this within 60 minutes of a high-mineral meal to prevent tannin interference.

### 3. Functional: With Mid-Day Tea

* **Mechanism:** High-temperature liquid (80°C/176°F) provides 100% solubility, eliminating texture issues.
* **Heat Stability:** Creatine is stable in hot liquids. Add the powder once the tea has finished boiling (approx. 80°C/176°F).
* **Consumption Window:** Drink the solution within 30 minutes of preparation to ensure 99%+ stability.
* **Note:** While this provides zero insulin response, which is required for maximum absorption of Creatine, it remains effective for maintenance once muscle saturation is reached. Best for Matcha, Olive Leaf, or Hawthorn rotations.
