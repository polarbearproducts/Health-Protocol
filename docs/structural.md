# Structural Reversal Power Stack

To target structural plaque reversal—specifically the hardening and narrowing of arteries—clinical research looks for substances that go beyond simple relaxation and actively address **calcification** and **plaque volume**.

When paired with your tea rotation, the following foods and supplements create a powerful synergy by addressing the three main components of plaque: calcium buildup, oxidized cholesterol, and inflammation.

| Supplement/Food | Role in Plaque Reversal | Pair With |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Vitamin K2 (MK-7)** | Clears calcium from artery walls. | **Hibiscus Tea** both lower BP. |
| **Pomegranate Juice** | Reduces physical wall thickness. | **Green Tea** synergistic antioxidants. |
| **Aged Garlic Extract** | Stops plaque from hardening. | **Morning Tea dose**. |
| **Lemon/Vitamin C** | Increases tea absorption by 500%. | **Every cup of tea**. |

## Synergy Protocol

To maximize these supplements alongside your tea:

### 1. Morning

With your hot Hibiscus Tea, take **D3/K2** and **Aged Garlic** with a meal containing healthy fats (avocado or eggs) to ensure the vitamins are absorbed.

### 2. Mid-Day

Drink your **Tea** with **Citrus Juice** to boost catechin absorption. Drink Pomegranate Juice.

### 3. Evening

Drink your **Hibiscus Tea**. Swish with plain water immediately after drinking Hibiscus tea to prevent damage to tooth Enamel.

### 5. Eat Calcium Rich Food

Have **150 mg to 250 mg** of calcium with non-milk-matcha teas to bind to oxalates, to reduce the risk of developing kidney stones. This calcium is sacrificial and should not be counted towards daily nutritional counts. (calories and other nutrients do) The matcha cold-brewed with milk do not require this addition.

* 1 oz Aged Gouda is ~225 mg per serving
* 6 oz Greek Yogurt has ~195 mg per serving
* 1/2 oz Parmesan has ~200 mg per serving
* 6 oz Feta has ~ 210 mg per serving
* 3 oz Ricotta has ~ 250 mg per serving

### 6. Calcium and Iron Levels

Drink tea 90 mins away from meals. Tea will prevent absorption of minerals, does not apply the the sacrificial calcium above.

### 7. Avoid Stomach Upset

Don't Drink Matcha or Olive Leaf on a 100% empty stomach.

### 8. Flush Oxalates

Drink 8 oz of plain water for every 2 cups of tea to flush oxalates, to avoid forming kidney stones.

## Shopping List

In clinical research, Clinical Grade refers to supplements that have been independently verified for purity, such as USP or NSF certification or are the exact patented versions used in successful human trials. Below are the specific brands and formulations most frequently cited in studies for arterial health and plaque management.

### 1. Aged Garlic Extract (AGE)

**Clinical Standard:** **Kyolic by Wakunaga of America**
This is the single most researched garlic brand in the world. It was used in the famous UCLA heart studies (Dr. Matthew Budoff) and the GarGIC trials.

* **The Formulation:** **Kyolic Formula 100 Cardiovascular** or **Kyolic Reserve**.
* **Clinical Dose:** Trials for plaque reversal typically use **1,200 mg to 2,400 mg** per day.
* **Key Marker:** Standardized to **S-allyl cysteine SAC**. Studies show that 2.4 mg of SAC daily is the threshold for slowing coronary calcification.

### 2. Vitamin K2 (MK-7)

**Clinical Standard: MenaQ7®, a Patented Ingredient**
Researchers rarely use generic K2. Most successful trials on arterial stiffness use **MenaQ7®**, a patented form of MK-7 derived from fermented chickpeas.

* **Where to find it:** Because MenaQ7 is an ingredient, you will find it inside high-end brands.
* **SwissRX:** Specifically uses the MenaQ7 PRO version used in cardiovascular research.
* **Thorne Vitamin D/K2 Liquid:** Highly regarded for its purity and used by professional athletic organizations.
* **Clinical Dose:** 180 mcg per day. (Note: New 2026 guidelines suggest up to 360 mcg/day is safe and effective for arterial health).

### 3. Vitamin D3

**Clinical Standard:** **Nature Made (USP Verified)** or **Pure Encapsulations**
For D3, the gold standard is **USP Verification** (U.S. Pharmacopeia), which ensures the bottle actually contains the IU amount listed.

* **Nature Made:** Holds the most USP-verified products in the US.
* **Pure Encapsulations:** Frequently used in clinical settings because they are "hypoallergenic" and free from fillers that might interfere with absorption.
* **Clinical Dose:**  (to be adjusted based on your blood serum levels).

### 4. Pomegranate Extract

**Clinical Standard:** **P40p™** or **POM Wonderful**
Research into carotid artery thickening specifically used **POM Wonderful** juice or the standardized extract **P40p**.

* **The Formulation:** Look for extracts standardized to **30% Punicalagins**.
* **Standardized Brand:** **Life Extension (Pomegranate Fruit Extract)** uses a standardized blend that mirrors the polyphenol profile used in clinical trials.
* **Clinical Dose:** Equivalent to **8oz of juice** or **400mg–1,000mg** of standardized extract.

### Summary Table for Clinical Grade Shopping

| Nutrient | Specific Clinical Brand/Ingredient | Key Certification to Look For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Aged Garlic** | **Kyolic (Formula 100)** | "Aged 20 Months" |
| **Vitamin K2** | **MenaQ7®** (found in SwissRX or Jarrow) | "Patented MK-7" |
| **Vitamin D3** | **Nature Made** or **Thorne** | **USP Verified** or **NSF** |
| **Pomegranate** | **Life Extension** or **POM Wonderful** | "Standardized Punicalagins" |

## Suppliments Effects in Structural Reversal Power Stack

### 1. Calcium Scavengers (Vitamin K2 + D3)

This is arguably the most important pairing for structural hardening.

* **The Synergy:** While **Vitamin D3** helps you absorb calcium, **Vitamin K2 (specifically the MK-7 form)** acts as a traffic cop. It activates a protein called *Matrix Gla Protein (MGP)*, which physically pulls calcium out of your arterial walls and shuttles it into your bones.
* **The Evidence:** A 2025 review indicates that combined deficiency in these vitamins is linked to significantly higher arterial stiffness. Long-term K2 intake is associated with a **50% reduction in arterial calcification**.
* **Clinical Dose:** Typically  of K2 (MK-7) alongside  of D3.

### 2. The Plaque Shrinker (Pomegranate Juice)

Pomegranate is one of the few natural substances with clinical evidence for actually **reducing** the thickness of the carotid artery.

* **The Synergy:** Pomegranate polyphenols (punicalagins) protect the **Nitric Oxide** produced by your tea from being destroyed by oxidative stress.
* **The Evidence:** In a famous 3rd-party trial, patients with carotid artery stenosis who drank pomegranate juice daily for one year saw a **30% reduction in carotid intima-media thickness** (the physical thickness of the artery wall).
* **Dosage:** 8 oz (240ml) of 100% pure, unsweetened pomegranate juice daily.

### 3. Bioavailability Booster (Vitamin C + Citrus)

Green tea and Hibiscus catechins are notoriously difficult for the body to absorb (often less than 20% reaches the bloodstream).

* **The Synergy:** Adding **Vitamin C** or citrus juice (lemon/lime) to your tea changes the pH level in your gut, preventing the tea's antioxidants from breaking down before they can be absorbed.
* **The Evidence:** Laboratory models show that adding citrus to green tea increases catechin recovery by **over 5 times**.
* **Practice:** Squeeze **half a lemon** into every cup of Green or Hibiscus tea.

### 4. Inflammation Shield (Aged Garlic Extract)

While raw garlic is great, **Aged Garlic Extract (AGE)** is what researchers use for structural plaque.

* **The Synergy:** It helps prevent "soft" plaque from turning into "hard" calcified plaque.
* **The Evidence:** Multiple studies using the brand **Kyolic** have shown a significantly slower progression of total plaque volume and a reduction in "low-attenuation" (vulnerable) plaque over a 12-month period.
* **Dosage:** 1,200mg to 2,400mg of Aged Garlic Extract daily.

## Timeframes

Structural reversal is much slower than functional blood pressure drops. While your blood pressure may stabilize in **4–6 weeks**, structural changes to the artery walls (like those seen in the pomegranate and K2 studies) generally require **12 to 36 months** of consistent adherence.
